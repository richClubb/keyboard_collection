Keyboard Collection
-------------------

# Keyboards

The idea is to have a really comprehensive collection with a large number of varieties.

## Types

The default for the row staggered is an ANSI with 0.25 spacing on the bottom row unless specified otherwise.

### Standard

* Tenkeyless
* 75%
* 65%
* 60%
* 40%
* 0.25 bottom row spacing ISO
* 0.5 bottom row spacing ISO
* 0.25 bottom row spacing ANSI
* 0.5 bottom row spacing ANSI

### Non-standard

* Dactyl Manuform
* Kyria
* Ortholinear

### Weird

* Lalboard
* Characorder?

## Switches

The switch tester could be done on a 65% It does not need to be a full TKL 

### Linear

* Low force
* Medium force unlubed
* Medium force lubed
* Strong force
* Silent

### Tactile

* Low force
* Medium force unlubed
* Medium force lubed
* Strong force
* Silent
* Holy pandas (the holy grail)

### Clicky

* Low force
* Medium force
* Strong force

### Low Profile

* Linear
* Tactile

# Notes

## 60% and 40%

Neither of these have navigtion keys so the boards should have all the keys on different function layers. They should be setup so that they are as functional as possible.

## Default switches / setup

I think these should have a fairly average setup, so a tactile medium force switch.

## Cost

This is likely to be about 80 - 100 switches per keyboard. It will be about 50 GBP per keyboard for the switches, and about 20 for each of the keycap sets. The PCB is likely not very costly but the biggest expense is probably going to be the case. I'm not sure how I'll sort it out. 

# Setup

I'd ideally like to have 1 screen for each keyboard set up but I doubt that I'll have 30 odd screens so it is more likely that I'll have 5-10 screens and the users will have to plug in and check them out yourself.
